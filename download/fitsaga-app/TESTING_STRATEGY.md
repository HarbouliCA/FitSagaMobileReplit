# FitSAGA Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the FitSAGA React Native application. It covers unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing approaches for all major components.

## 1. Testing Tools & Framework

| Testing Type | Primary Tools |
|--------------|---------------|
| Unit Testing | Jest, React Native Testing Library |
| Integration Testing | Jest, React Native Testing Library, Mock Service Worker |
| End-to-End Testing | Detox |
| Manual Testing | Expo Go, Physical Devices |
| Firebase Testing | Firebase Local Emulator Suite |

## 2. Current Testing Status

### 2.1 Implemented Tests

We have successfully implemented and verified the following core test suites:

| Test File | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| rbacTest.js | Role-based access control testing | ✅ PASSING |
| creditSystemTest.js | Credit system functionality testing | ✅ PASSING |
| sessionBookingTest.js | Session booking and management testing | ✅ PASSING |
| tutorialSystemTest.js | Tutorial content and progress tracking testing | ✅ PASSING |
| firebaseAuthTest.js | Firebase authentication integration testing | ✅ PASSING |
| basicTest.js | Basic utility function testing | ✅ PASSING |

### 2.2 Test Runner

We've implemented a comprehensive test runner (`runTests.js`) to execute all test suites sequentially and report results with proper formatting. This tool:

- Executes each test file in sequence
- Provides colorized console output for better readability
- Reports detailed pass/fail statistics
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Groups test results by status (passed, failed, skipped)

To run all tests:

```bash
node runTests.js
```

## 3. Component-Specific Testing Strategies

- ✅ Firebase user data retrieval
- ✅ Firebase Firestore operations

### 4.2 Future Enhancements
- Add Firebase Storage testing for video assets
- Add Firebase security rules testing
- Add Firebase Functions testing for serverless operations

## 5. Test Automation

### 5.1 Continuous Integration Setup
For future CI/CD pipeline implementation, we recommend:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: FitSAGA Test Suite

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: node runTests.js
      - name: Start Firebase emulators
        run: npm run emulators:start
      - name: Run Firebase tests
        run: npm run test:firebase
```

### 5.2 Future Script Additions
We recommend adding these scripts to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "node runTests.js",
  "test:unit": "jest --testPathPattern=src/tests/unit",
  "test:integration": "jest --testPathPattern=src/tests/integration",
  "test:e2e": "detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug",
  "test:firebase": "jest --testPathPattern=src/tests/firebase",
  "emulators:start": "firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore",
  "emulators:seed": "node scripts/seed-emulators.js"
}
```

## 6. Performance Testing Recommendations

For future performance testing:

- Measure app load times across different devices
- Test video playback performance with different network conditions
- Analyze Firebase query performance with large datasets
- Monitor memory usage during extended app sessions

## 7. Cross-Platform Testing Plan

### 7.1 iOS-Specific Tests
- UI rendering on different iOS devices
- iOS-specific permissions handling
- Apple Sign-In integration
- Background processing

### 7.2 Android-Specific Tests
- UI rendering on different Android devices
- Android permissions handling
- Back button behavior
- Notification handling

## 8. Next Steps in Testing

1. **Test Coverage Enhancement**:
   - Add edge case tests for credit transactions
   - Add load testing for session booking under high demand
   - Add cross-device synchronization tests for tutorial progress

2. **Test Automation**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Implement nightly test runs
   - Create test coverage reports

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Implement benchmark tests for critical operations
   - Add video playback performance tests
   - Test Firebase query optimizations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create test case documentation for manual testing
   - Document test procedures for new feature development

## 9. Conclusion

The FitSAGA app has a robust testing foundation with comprehensive tests for all critical components. All test suites are currently passing, validating the core functionality of the application. The test runner provides an easy way to verify application integrity, and the structured testing approach ensures systematic coverage of all application features.

As development continues, this testing strategy should evolve to incorporate new features and edge cases while maintaining a high standard of quality assurance.
